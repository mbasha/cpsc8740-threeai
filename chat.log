User: I am writing a simple demo app. It is going to contain three different applications: a calculator, tic tac toe, and a to-do list. They need to be simple and functional apps. They need to have a web user interface that I can execute locally. I'd like to write this in Go. Let's start by scaffloding the application. I would like for you to Create a "entry point" where I can select the app that I want to use. Then I want three different sections for the code that will be each of the respective apps. Let's try it it. Ask clarifying questions if you aren't 95% certain about a decision

GitHub Copilot: I'd like to clarify a few things before scaffolding:

1. **Frontend approach**: Should I render HTML templates server-side (simpler, classic approach) or would you prefer a separate frontend with something like HTML/CSS/JavaScript or a JavaScript framework?

2. **To-do list persistence**: Should the to-do list be:
   - In-memory only (resets when the server restarts)?
   - Persist to a JSON file or SQLite database?

3. **Go web framework**: Should I use:
   - Standard library `net/http` (minimal dependencies, more boilerplate)?
   - A lightweight framework like Gin or Echo (cleaner routing)?

4. **Styling**: Just basic functional HTML, or would you like some CSS styling to make it look nice?

My recommendation if you're not particular: **server-side HTML templates** with the **standard library** (keeps it lightweight and dependency-free), **in-memory storage** for the demo (simplest), and **basic CSS styling** for usability. This gives you a self-contained, runnable demo without complexity.

Sound good, or would you prefer different choices?

User: Let's go with server-side, standard library, persistent json storage, and css styling. Ideally, keep the styling modern but not terribly complicated (code-wise)

# Three AI Demo Apps

A simple Go web application featuring three demo apps: Calculator, Tic Tac Toe, and a To-Do List.

## Features

- **Calculator**: Basic arithmetic operations with a clean interface
- **Tic Tac Toe**: Play against a simple AI opponent
- **To-Do List**: Manage tasks with persistent JSON storage

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go with standard library (`net/http`)
- **Frontend**: Server-side HTML templates with modern CSS
- **Storage**: JSON file persistence (stored in `data/` directory)

## Project Structure

```

```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later

### Running the Application

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/cpsc8740-threeai
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

### Using the Apps

#### Home Page
Select which app you want to use from the main dashboard.

#### Calculator
- Click number buttons to enter values
- Use operator buttons (+, -, ×, ÷) for operations
- Press = to calculate results
- Use C to clear and DEL to delete the last digit

#### Tic Tac Toe
- You are X, the computer is O
- Click any empty cell to make your move
- The computer will automatically respond
- Click "New Game" to reset the board

#### To-Do List
- Type a task and click "Add" or press Enter
- Check the checkbox to mark tasks complete
- Click "Delete" to remove tasks
- Your tasks are automatically saved to JSON

## Data Storage

To-Do List items are persistently stored in `data/todos.json`. The file is automatically created when you add your first task.

## Styling

All styling is done with modern CSS using CSS custom properties (variables) for easy theming. The design is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Building for Production

To create a standalone executable:

```bash
go build -o threeai
./threeai
```

Or for a specific OS:

```bash
# macOS
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o threeai

Perfect! Now let me verify the structure is correct and the app is ready to run: 

Ran terminal command:  find . -type f -name "*.go" -o -name "*.html" -o -name "*.css" -o -name "*.mod" | sort

Excellent! Let me test building the application to make sure there are no compile errors: 

Ran terminal command:  go build -o threeai 2>&1

Let me fix that unused import: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Ran terminal command:  go build -o threeai 2>&1

Perfect! The build succeeded. Let me verify the executable was created and show the final project structure: 

Ran terminal command:  ls -la threeai && tree -L 2 -I 'threeai|*.go|*.html|*.css|*.mod|*.sum'

Ran terminal command:  find . -type f | grep -E "\.(go|html|css|mod|json)$" | sort

Perfect! Your application is now fully scaffolded and ready to run. Here's what I've created:

User: That was a good first attempt. There are some things that need to be fixed. Specifically, the calculator rendering is off. The top has the output, the C and DEL are across the top, which is good. The rest of the numbers are a mess though. The order, from left to right for row 1: / x 7 8; row 2: 9 - 4 5; row 3: 6 + 1 2; row 4: 3 . 0; row 5 (only half the row taken, left aligned) = . Make this a logical calculator layout

GitHub Copilot: Read [](file:///Users/abrar/Documents/code/Clemson/cpsc8740-threeai/templates/calculator.html#60-60), lines 60 to 85

Let me see the button structure: 

Read [](file:///Users/abrar/Documents/code/Clemson/cpsc8740-threeai/templates/calculator.html#110-110), lines 110 to 165

I see the issue. Let me fix the calculator button layout to be a proper 4-column grid with the correct ordering: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now fix the button grid structure: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! I've fixed the calculator layout. The grid is now properly organized as a standard 4-column calculator:

**New layout:**
- Row 1: C, DEL, /, ×
- Row 2: 7, 8, 9, −
- Row 3: 4, 5, 6, +
- Row 4: 1, 2, 3, =
- Row 5: 0 (spans 2 columns), .

This is the standard calculator layout you'd expect. The buttons are now in logical order for easy number entry.

Made changes.

User: Okay, there's one more issue. No matter what calculator I do, when I hit equals, the output is Error. Please fix it

GitHub Copilot: Read [](file:///Users/abrar/Documents/code/Clemson/cpsc8740-threeai/calculator/calculator.go)

The backend looks fine. The issue is likely that the backend is receiving different operation symbols than what it expects. Let me check the JavaScript to see what's being sent. The problem is that in the HTML, the JavaScript is sending different characters for operations. Let me look at the current calculator HTML: 

Read [](file:///Users/abrar/Documents/code/Clemson/cpsc8740-threeai/templates/calculator.html#100-100), lines 100 to 165

I see the problem! The button for minus is using `−` (a minus sign U+2212) but the addOperator is passing `-`. Same with the multiplication button showing `×` but passing `*`. These Unicode characters are being displayed, but let me check what's actually being passed to the backend. The issue is that the `−` character displayed on the button is not the same as the `-` character being passed.

Actually, looking more carefully, I notice the button onclick is `addOperator('-')` for minus and `addOperator('*')` for multiply, but it's showing `−` and `×`. That should be fine - the onclick value is what matters.

The real issue is likely the operation symbols. Let me check the performCalculation function more carefully. The problem might be that the backend expects `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` but something else is being sent, OR there's an issue with how the operation is stored.

Let me run the app and check the browser console to see what errors are being thrown: 

Ran terminal command:  go run main.go &

The server is already running. Let me check what the actual issue is by looking at the JavaScript more carefully. I think the problem might be in how the operation is being handled. Let me look at the full JavaScript section: 

Read [](file:///Users/abrar/Documents/code/Clemson/cpsc8740-threeai/templates/calculator.html#156-156), lines 156 to 226

I found the issue! In the `calculate()` function, after calling `performCalculation()`, the code immediately resets `operation` to an empty string. But `performCalculation()` is asynchronous (it uses fetch), so by the time the fetch completes, the operation has already been cleared and the response will fail because the backend still needs the operation value.

Actually, wait - looking more carefully, the backend already has the operation value when the fetch is made, so that's not the issue. But the real problem is that `performCalculation()` is being called and it's checking `if (firstNumber === '' || operation === '' || secondNumber === '') return;` before making the request, and all three need to be set.

Let me trace through what happens:
1. User enters `5`, display shows `5`
2. User clicks `+`, firstNumber becomes `5`, operation becomes `+`, shouldClearDisplay is true
3. User enters `3`, display becomes `3`
4. User clicks `=`, secondNumber becomes `3`, then performCalculation() is called
5. performCalculation() should have firstNumber=`5`, operation=`+`, secondNumber=`3`

That should work. But wait - I need to check if the operation is being properly stored. Let me add some better error handling and actually test what's being sent. Let me look at the issue more carefully - the problem might be URL encoding. Let me update the calculator to properly encode the data: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me also fix the backend to handle method checking properly: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Good! I've made two key improvements:

1. **JavaScript**: Added proper URL encoding with `encodeURIComponent()` to ensure special characters are properly encoded when sent to the server
2. **Go Backend**: 
   - Added explicit `r.ParseForm()` to properly parse the form data
   - Added check for operation parameter (was missing before)
   - Added method validation to ensure only POST requests are accepted
   - Improved error responses

The calculator should now work properly. The issue was likely that the form data wasn't being explicitly parsed and the operation parameter check was missing.

Made changes.
